QCGC is an implementation of Mike Pall's LuaJIT 3.0 garbage collector
(http://wiki.luajit.org/New-Garbage-Collector) as a C library. It has been
integrated into [PyPy](https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/src/quad-color-gc).

A first report containing basic benchmarking results can be found
[here](reports/thesis.pdf).
